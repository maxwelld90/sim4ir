# sim4ir @ SIGIR 2021

This repository houses everything we need for the SIGIR 2021 workshop on simulation, *sim4IR*.

sim4IR is organised by:

* Krisztian Balog
* David Maxwell
* Paul Thomas
* Zhang Shuo

The github.io branch of this repository houses the static website hosted at https://www.sim4ir.org. You can access the code for the website by running the following commands.

`git clone https://github.com/maxwelld90/sim4ir`

`cd sim4ir`

`git checkout github.io`

Your workspace should then be switched over to the `github.io` branch.
