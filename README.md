# `sim4ir.org`

This branch of the *sim4IR* repository houses the code for the static, Jekyll-powered website hosted at [`https://www.sim4ir.org`](https://www.sim4ir.org).

You will find all the necessary code in the `docs` directory. All content is provided by the files with the `.markdown` extension. Edit these at will, and push the changes for a GitHub action to force a rebuild of the website. This should take about two minutes to appear. To see the changes, you'll need to hard refresh your browser!

We use the Dinky theme as the starting point for the page layout; this has been extended to have a slightly different look and feel, with some green and black text, which makes things *scream simulation.*
