# Submission Guidelines

We welcome submissions of **regular papers (4-6 pages)** that present original technical, theoretical, or experimental contributions; **position papers (2-4 pages)** that explore controversial, risk-taking or nascent ideas that have the potential to spark debate and discussion at the workshop; **demonstrator papers (max 4 pages)** that present first-hand experience with research prototypes or operational systems. Submissions are single-blind and should use a **standard double-column ACM SIG proceedings format.**

In addition to the paper contributions, we also invite submissions of **encore talks**, to present work that has already been published in a leading conference or journal, but is relevant to the topics of this workshop.  We require a copy of the paper along with a brief (max 200 words) statement of relevance.

> **~~The submission deadline for papers is 23:59 (AOE) on May 4, 2021. Encore talk submissions are due at 23:59 (AOE) on May 18, 2021.~~**
